Development of the OWL/RFDS schema for the 
[Open Annotation Data model](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/)

The official version of this schema is at
http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/schema.xml and
should at a later stage be released at W3C namespace URI
http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#

RDFS/OWL version by:
* Robert Sanderson
* Stian Soiland-Reyes

Comments and labels are typically taking verbatim from the 
specification at http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/

The owl:imports lines are commented out, and *SHOULD NOT* be included in
the published OWL. You may want to include these to ease
editing in tools like Protege and avoid redeclaring classes
of skos and rdfs.

The diff\*.ttl files shows latest changes to the OWL.
