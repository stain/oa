Development of the OWL/RFDS schema for the 
[Open Annotation Data model](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/)

The official version of this schema is at
http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/schema.xml and
should at a later stage be released at W3C namespace URI
http://www.w3.org/ns/openannotation/core/

RDFS/OWL version by:
* Robert Sanderson
* Stian Soiland-Reyes

Comments and labels are typically taking verbatim from the 
specification at http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/

The owl:imports lines are included for convenience while
editing the ontology in Protege, and *SHOULD NOT* be included
in the published OWL.
